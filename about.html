                <p>
                    Pinnacle Wealth Management was founded in 1987 by Edmund Whitmore III, a visionary financial advisor 
                    with a singular mission: to provide the nation's most prominent families and institutions with 
                    sophisticated, personalized wealth management services grounded in timeless principles of integrity 
                    and prudence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What began as a boutique advisory practice with a handful of clients has evolved into one of the 
                    region's most respected private wealth management firms, serving over 500 high-net-worth families and 
                    institutional clients. Throughout our 37-year history, we have maintained our commitment to our founding 
                    principles: putting clients first, acting with unwavering integrity, and delivering exceptional results 
                    through disciplined, thoughtful financial stewardship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As markets have evolved, economies have transformed, and investment opportunities have proliferated, 
                    our team has continuously adapted and refined our approach. Yet our fundamental philosophy remains 
                    unchanged: true wealth management is not about chasing returns or market timing—it's about building and 
                    preserving generational wealth through prudent strategy, disciplined execution, and genuine partnership 
                    with our clients.
